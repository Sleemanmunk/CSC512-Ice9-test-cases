EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED
All tests are now in a "tests" directory
correct tests and broken tests are separated by a comment on or near their first line describing what they should output.
There is now a test.py file that can be used to test your compiler. Be sure to open it and read the documentation inside before you use it!
Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!
